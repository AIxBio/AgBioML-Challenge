task_description: |
  Develop an accurate epigenetic clock model that predicts chronological age from DNA methylation data,
  with the aim of achieving state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating comprehensive
  machine learning practices including proper data splitting, model evaluation, and documentation.

project_goal: |
  Create a predictive model that accurately estimates chronological age from DNA methylation
  beta values, achieving a Pearson correlation ≥ 0.9 and MAE < 10 years on the held-out test set.
  
  CRITICAL COMPLETION CRITERIA:
  1. Test set performance: Pearson correlation ≥ 0.9 AND MAE < 10 years
  2. Model checkpoint: Save the best-performing model with an accompanying inference script
  3. Analysis report: Complete markdown report documenting research, methods, and results
  4. Predictions file: Generate predictions.arrow for the held-out test set (REQUIRED for evaluation)
  
  The project is considered complete only when ALL criteria are met and the Principal Scientist
  explicitly confirms completion by including "TASK_COMPLETE" in their message.

    - path: data/agent/metadata.arrow
      description: Sample metadata including chronological ages (target), tissue types, sex, and study IDs - FOR ANALYSIS ONLY, NOT FOR MODELING (except age as target)

data_completeness: |
  IMPORTANT: All data necessary to complete this task has been provided. The agents MUST work with these files:
  - betas.arrow and metadata.arrow contain all required information for training
  - Sample IDs in both files match perfectly - there are NO missing mappings
  - No additional data files, ID mapping files, or external resources are needed or should be requested
  - The data is complete, properly formatted, and sufficient to achieve the performance criteria
  
  The data has been mined from several hundred DNA methylation studies. To assess generalization,
  data should be split with respect to the study of origin when creating train/validation splits
  from the provided training data. This prevents data leakage and ensures robust model evaluation.

feature_constraints: |
  **CRITICAL FEATURE RESTRICTION FOR REAL-WORLD DEPLOYMENT:**
  
  Your model MUST work with DNA methylation data ONLY. You will NOT have access to gender, sex, 
  tissue type, or any other clinical/demographic information at test time (deployment).
  
  **FORBIDDEN FEATURES:**
  - Gender/sex information
  - Tissue type information  
  - Any clinical or demographic variables beyond DNA methylation
  
  **ALLOWED FEATURES:**
  - ONLY DNA methylation beta values (CpG sites)
  - NO other metadata fields
  
  **WHY THIS MATTERS:**
  In real-world deployment (forensics, clinical applications), you will only receive DNA methylation 
  data without any additional information. Models that depend on gender, sex, or tissue type will 
  FAIL in production.
  
  **VALIDATION REQUIREMENT:**
  You MUST demonstrate that your model works using ONLY the methylation features. Any model that 
  uses metadata beyond sample IDs will be rejected as non-deployable.
  
  The metadata.arrow file contains additional information for your analysis and understanding, 
  but your final model must be trained using ONLY the methylation beta values from betas.arrow.

prediction_requirements: |
  To complete the evaluation, you MUST follow a two-stage process:
  
  1. **PUBLIC EVALUATION (REQUIRED FIRST):**
     - Train your model using the training data (betas.arrow and metadata.arrow)
     - Generate predictions for betas_heldout_public.arrow and save as 'predictions_public.arrow'
     - Use the evaluate_on_public_test tool to assess performance (up to 5 attempts)
     - Refine your model based on public test results
  
  2. **FINAL PREDICTIONS (AFTER PUBLIC EVALUATION):**
     - Once satisfied with public test performance, generate predictions for betas_heldout_private.arrow
     - Save final predictions as 'predictions.arrow' with:
       - Column 'sample_id': Sample identifiers matching those in betas_heldout_private.arrow
     - Column 'predicted_age': Your model's age predictions (float)
  
  CRITICAL: You MUST evaluate on the public test set at least once before creating final predictions.
  The public test represents 50% of the final test data and gives you reliable performance estimates.
