When implementing your solution, follow these heuristics:

1. DATA UNDERSTANDING:
   - Always start by exploring and understanding the data structure (column names, data types, missing values)
   - Print shapes, descriptive statistics, and a few sample rows first
   - Check for missing data, outliers, or unusual distributions before proceeding

2. TROUBLESHOOTING APPROACH:
   - When you encounter an error, simplify your code to isolate the problem
   - Test individual components separately before combining them
   - Print intermediate results to verify each step works as expected
   - When debugging, start with the simplest possible version of your code

3. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY:
   - Start small with atomic, focused steps that do one thing well
   - Test each component separately before combining them
   - Build up complexity incrementally, verifying at each step
   - Use intermediate data files to break complex processes into manageable stages

4. PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY:
   - Use sampling for initial testing when working with large datasets
   - Monitor memory usage and optimize for large data processing
   - Create clear, informative visualizations with proper labels and titles
   - Add useful comments explaining WHY, not just WHAT your code does

5. DATA SPLITTING BEST PRACTICES:
   - Always maintain stratification for important variables when splitting
   - Check the distributions in your train/test splits to ensure they're representative
   - Verify there's no data leakage between splits
   - Use k-fold cross-validation when appropriate to ensure stable results

6. OUTPUT VALIDATION:
   - Generate summary statistics for each data split and compare them
   - Create plots showing distributions across splits to visually confirm balance
   - Use statistical tests to verify similarity between splits
   - Create clear tables showing counts and percentages of key variables across splits

Remember to check your results at each step and build up complexity gradually.

The following tools can help you evaluate the implementation:
- search_directory("{self._output_dir}", "*.png") to find visualization files
- analyze_plot("{self._output_dir}/filename.png") to examine any visualizations of interest
- search_directory("{self._output_dir}", "*") to see all output files
- read_notebook() to see the project history and context

You can use these tools as needed to support your assessment. Tools are particularly helpful for examining visualizations that seem relevant to your evaluation. In your first review, examining some visualizations is recommended but not mandatory.

In follow-up reviews, you can focus primarily on whether the engineer addressed your previous feedback and only analyze plots that are new or relevant to the changes.

IMPORTANT: After completing your review, if you APPROVE the implementation, also document significant metrics and results in the lab notebook:
