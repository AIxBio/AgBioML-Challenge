# Refactoring Summary

## Completed Refactoring

We have successfully refactored key components of the Flock-AG codebase to improve modularity, readability, and maintainability:

1. **Created a dedicated `agents.py` module**:
   - Moved the `EngineerSociety` custom agent implementation to a separate file
   - Extracted the `estimate_tokens` function to the same module
   - Made the agent implementation more generic and reusable

2. **Extracted task prompts to `prompts.yaml`**:
   - Moved all system prompts and task text to a structured YAML file
   - Organized prompts by task category (understanding, eda, data_split)
   - Added support for prompt templating with format parameters

3. **Added utility functions in `utils.py`**:
   - `load_task_prompts()`: Loads prompts from YAML file
   - `get_task_text()`: Retrieves and formats specific task prompts
   - `get_system_prompt()`: Retrieves system prompts for agents
   - `get_checklist()`: Retrieves checklists like the plot quality checklist

4. **Created refactored examples**:
   - Refactored `run_understanding_task()` to use YAML prompts
   - Refactored `run_subtask_2()` to use the new agent module and YAML prompts

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Task prompts can be modified without changing Python code
   - Agent system prompts are defined in a single location
   - Custom agent implementations are centralized

2. **Better Code Organization**:
   - Clear separation between code and prompts
   - Modular structure makes it easier to understand and modify
   - Custom agent implementations are reusable across scripts

3. **Reduced Duplication**:
   - Eliminated duplicate prompt definitions across files
   - Standardized agent initialization pattern
   - Reuse of common agent classes

## Next Steps

To complete the refactoring of the codebase:

1. **Refactor Script Files**:
   - Update `01_understand_problem.py` to use the refactored approach
   - Update `02_eda.py` to use the YAML prompts and custom agent modules
   - Update `03_split_data.py` to use the new structure

2. **Update Agent Initialization**:
   - Use the standard `initialize_agents()` function consistently
   - Update references to hardcoded system prompts to use `get_system_prompt()`

3. **Implement Helper Functions**:
   - Add functions to assist with plot visualization requirements
   - Consolidate common task environment setup code

4. **Testing**:
   - Test each refactored script to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Verify that the YAML-based prompts are properly loaded and formatted

## Implementation Approach

For each Python script file, follow these steps:

1. Import the new utility functions:
   ```python
   from altum_v1.utils import (
       get_task_text,
       get_system_prompt,
       get_checklist,
   )
   from altum_v1.agents import EngineerSociety
   ```

2. Replace hardcoded task texts with calls to `get_task_text()`:
   ```python
   # Before
   task_text = SUBTASK_1_TEXT
   
   # After
   task_text = get_task_text("data_split", "subtask_1")
   ```

3. Replace hardcoded system prompts with calls to `get_system_prompt()`:
   ```python
   # Before
   system_message = CRITIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT
   
   # After
   system_message = get_system_prompt("critic")
   ```

4. Use the `EngineerSociety` from the agents module instead of defining it inline.

5. Test the refactored code to ensure functionality is maintained.

## Conclusion

This refactoring makes the codebase more modular, maintainable, and easier to extend. By separating the prompts from the code and centralizing agent implementations, we've improved the overall architecture and reduced duplication. The next step is to systematically apply these changes to all the relevant Python files in the project.
